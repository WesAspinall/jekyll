# Tonight, I Saved the World

Well, kinda. 

As you all know, Haiti is hurting pretty badly and they need all the help they can get. Organizations like the Red Cross would be better equipped to plan and execute relief efforts if Haiti (and other impoverished nations) had adequate map data.

That's where the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team ([https://hotosm.org/get-involved](https://hotosm.org/get-involved)) comes in. Through the use of open-sourced software, the enormous task of gathering map data can be distributed amongst a much larger group of people.

Tonight, I spent a few hours with Code for Miami identifying buildings in rural parts of Haiti on a satellite map so responders can reach those in need.

You can do this as well by clicking here:

It's not difficult. If you need a walk-through I can show you.

*things you need: a laptop

Thnx fr rdng,
