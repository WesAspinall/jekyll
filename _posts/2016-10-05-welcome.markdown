# Welcome to my blog. 
Here, I will go into detail about what I'm working on and what I'm currently learning. I've been hitting AngularJS 1.5.x pretty hard lately, and I thought it would be a good idea to share.

In the meantime, check out the [github repo] to review your knowledge of AngularJS. I go through transclusion, form validation, component-based architecture and more. Everything is based on Todd Motto's way of building AngularJS apps. 

Thnx fr rdng,

Wes
